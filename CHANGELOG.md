# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Require OAuth discovery metadata to match the configured issuer and use HTTPS for public signing keys, preserving explicit local HTTP deployments and separate HTTPS key hosts.
- Refuse token-exchange redirects so subject tokens and trusted-proxy secrets stay at the configured endpoint.
- Keep the token-exchange deadline active through success and error response bodies, allowing a fresh exchange after a stalled response times out.
- Add socket-free signed-token, discovery, exchange, and session-cache regressions to CI.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `find_doc_by_title` resolves exact document-title matches from workspace metadata, supports optional case-insensitive matching, returns every match up to a configurable limit, and reports whether results were truncated.
- `create_doc` now accepts `folderId` so newly created docs can be placed directly inside an existing AFFiNE sidebar folder.
- CodeRabbit auto-review configuration now covers `develop` and `release/*` branches.

### Changed
- npm publishing now uses GitHub Actions trusted publishing with OIDC on Node.js 24 instead of an `NPM_TOKEN` secret.
- Docker image publishing now runs on release tags or manual dispatch only, keeping develop PR checks focused on code validation.

### Fixed
- `create_doc` now links folder placement through the organize tree and returns explicit folder placement receipt fields, with warnings when folder placement fails after document creation.
- `find_doc_by_title` now only marks responses as truncated when matches exceed the requested limit and falls back to creation time when workspace metadata has no updated time.

### Security
- Refreshed locked transitive dependencies to clear npm audit findings, including `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `express-rate-limit`, `path-to-regexp`, `socket.io-parser`, `ws`, `ajv`, `fast-uri`, and `ip-address`.

### Tests
- Added coverage for `find_doc_by_title` and `create_doc` folder placement, and wired both flows into comprehensive and E2E validation.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- First-class edgeless canvas support on the native BlockSuite schema (no overlay types). Eight new tools cover the full surface: `add_surface_element`, `list_surface_elements`, `update_surface_element`, `delete_surface_element` (shapes, connectors, canvas text, groups on `affine:surface` → `prop:elements`), plus `update_edgeless_block`, `delete_block`, `update_frame_children`, and `get_edgeless_canvas` — closing the gap where notes, frames, and edgeless-text blocks were append-only.
- Layout helpers on `append_block`: `x` / `y` for canvas blocks, `stackAfter` for direction-aware placement relative to one or more siblings (default gap 80px horizontal / 40px vertical, orthogonal-axis centering), `childElementIds` to write `prop:childElementIds` like the editor's drag-into-frame flow so dragging the frame drags every owned member. When `y` is omitted, new edgeless blocks stack below the bottommost existing block.
- `get_edgeless_canvas` returns edgeless blocks with parsed `{x, y, width, height}`, all surface elements with bounds, aggregate bounding box, per-type counts, and structured `children[]` per note so markdown-seeded content round-trips with heading / list / code semantics. Z-order is deterministic (fractional-index sort).
- Connector auto-snap: when both endpoints are bound by id and positions are omitted, `add_surface_element(type="connector")` picks one of BlockSuite's four tangent-carrying side-midpoints using the editor's tiered axis rule. `labelXYWH` is seeded at the source→target midpoint so labels render on first paint.
- Markdown-seeded notes: `append_block(type="note", markdown: "...")` parses into heading / paragraph / list / code child blocks, mirroring BlockSuite's paste-into-note behavior. `append_block(type="edgeless_text", text: "…")` auto-attaches a child paragraph so the block renders glyphs.
- `src/edgeless/layout.ts` — dependency-free pure-function layout module (`pickConnectorSides`, `stackRelativeTo`, `encloseBounds`, `estimateNoteHeightForMarkdown`, `sortByFractionalIndex`, …).
- `docs/edgeless-canvas-cookbook.md` worked walkthrough; `tests/test-canvas-tool-map-demo.mjs` doubles as the regression guard for stacking, frame ownership, connector snapping, and label seeding, wired into `tests/run-e2e.sh`.
- Tool surface profiles via `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=full`, `read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` for least-privilege deployments.

### Changed
- Breaking: the public tool surface was reduced from the unreleased 95 registered tools to 84 canonical tools by removing redundant convenience tools and consolidating overlapping flows behind the canonical APIs.
- `get_capabilities`, `tool-manifest.json`, and `tools/list` now report the same public surface, including profile-filtered views.

### Fixed
- `extractTableData` now reads `affine:table` blocks stored with flat dot-notation Y.js keys (`prop:rows.{rowId}.order`, `prop:columns.{colId}.order`, `prop:cells.{rowId}:{colId}.text`) used by self-hosted AFFiNE instances. Previously `block.get("prop:rows")` returned `undefined` for this schema, causing all table exports to show empty tables with `had no readable cell data` warnings.
- Caller-supplied note `background` strings are no longer silently replaced with the default Y.Map. The default-background helper is now shared across note creation and template instantiation so they cannot drift.
- Default stroke and text colors on surface connectors, canvas text, and edgeless-text blocks moved off hardcoded `#000000` onto `--affine-text-primary-color`, restoring legibility in dark mode. Shape labels stay at `#000000` to match AFFiNE's native `shapeTextColor` (shape fills are fixed palette colors).
- Tool filtering now fails closed when profiles or disabled-tool configuration reference unknown tools.

### Removed
- Removed redundant public tools: `append_paragraph`, `batch_create_docs`, `cleanup_orphan_embeds`, `create_doc_from_template`, `duplicate_doc`, `find_and_replace`, `get_doc_by_title`, `get_docs_by_tag`, `list_backlinks`, `list_unresolved_threads`, and `update_database_cell`.

### Tests
- Added focused coverage for tool surface profile filtering and manifest consistency.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- High-level AFFiNE-native workflows:
  - `create_semantic_page`
  - `append_semantic_section`
  - `compose_database_from_intent`
  - `inspect_template_structure`
  - `instantiate_template_native`
  - `get_capabilities`
  - `analyze_doc_fidelity`
  - `export_with_fidelity_report`
  - `update_collection_rules`
  - `create_workspace_blueprint`
  - `list_unresolved_threads`
- Structured mutation receipts for write-oriented document, workspace, and comment flows.
- Productized documentation under `docs/` with dedicated getting-started, client setup, deployment, workflow, and tool reference guides.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 76 to 87 canonical tools.
- Document creation and duplication flows now support placement-aware creation and richer machine-readable receipts.
- Native template, fidelity, and capability workflows now surface explicit loss-risk and feature support metadata.
- Release and setup documentation now include first-class Docker and HTTP deployment paths.

### Fixed
- Rich-text marks are preserved for paragraphs, headings, quotes, and callouts instead of degrading to raw markdown syntax.
- `list_docs` now treats timestamp-only tombstone snapshots as deleted documents, preventing stale GraphQL edges from resurfacing after `delete_doc`.
- Document discovery end-to-end coverage now waits for eventual workspace convergence after delete/list synchronization.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for structured receipts, semantic page composition, placement-aware document creation, intent-driven databases, capability/fidelity reporting, native templates, organize flows, and supporting tools.
- Re-ran full Docker-backed Playwright validation through `npm run test:e2e`.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed GitHub Actions and runtime/development dependencies, including `actions/github-script`, `actions/checkout`, `docker/build-push-action`, `docker/metadata-action`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `undici`, and `@types/node`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Database rows can now point to linked AFFiNE documents via `linkedDocId` on `add_database_row`, `update_database_cell`, and `update_database_row`. `read_database_cells` now returns `linkedDocId` when present.
- Release tags now publish multi-arch GHCR images with a committed Docker runtime (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.github/workflows/docker.yml`) and documented container startup instructions.

### Fixed
- Database row read, update, and delete flows now work for rows created from the AFFiNE UI, even when the row is attached through database children instead of `sys:parent`.
- `extractTableData` now reads `affine:table` blocks stored with flat dot-notation Y.js keys (`prop:rows.{rowId}.order`, `prop:columns.{colId}.order`, `prop:cells.{rowId}:{colId}.text`) used by self-hosted AFFiNE instances. Previously `block.get("prop:rows")` returned `undefined` for this schema, causing table exports to show empty tables with `had no readable cell data` warnings.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for linked database rows in `tests/test-database-linked-doc.mjs`.
- Added live regression coverage for UI-created database rows in `tests/test-database-ui-rows.mjs`.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed locked dependencies used by verification flows, including `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `1.29.0` and `@playwright/test` `1.59.1`.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `list_docs` now filters out deleted documents that briefly remain in GraphQL edges after workspace metadata has already dropped them.
- Completed the delete/list_docs hardening introduced in `v1.11.1` so the visible edge list, `totalCount`, and `endCursor` stay aligned after `delete_doc`.

### Tests
- Re-ran live delete/list regression coverage against Dockerized AFFiNE `0.26.4` with `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `list_docs` now clamps stale `totalCount` metadata after `delete_doc` removes a document but AFFiNE GraphQL still reports the pre-delete count.
- `list_docs.pageInfo.endCursor` now aligns with the last returned edge cursor after delete-driven metadata drift.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for delete/list count correction in `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Sidebar organize workflows:
  - `list_collections`

  - `remove_doc_from_collection`
  - `list_organize_nodes`
  - `create_folder`
  - `rename_folder`
  - `delete_folder`
  - `move_organize_node`
  - `add_organize_link`
  - `delete_organize_link`

- Markdown import now preserves inline rich-text marks in list items and table cells.
- CLI setup now supports non-interactive login with `affine-mcp login --url ... --token ... --workspace-id ... --force`.
- `affine-mcp status --json` now returns machine-readable connection details.
- `affine-mcp snippet all --env` now prints Claude, Cursor, and Codex setup in a single response.
- README and release-facing docs now describe organize tools, tool filtering, and the new database row delete workflow.

### Fixed
- Table-cell and list-item markdown imports no longer keep literal `**...**` markers when AFFiNE rich-text attributes should be written.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed GitHub Actions, runtime lockfile entries, and development tooling, including `actions/github-script`, `jose`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `undici`, `yjs`, `typescript`, and `@types/node`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Refreshed packaged `README.md` and release metadata so the published v1.10.x docs match the shipped toolset.
- `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` now runs Docker-backed `npm run test:e2e` before `npm publish`.

- Focused HTTP transport regression coverage for bearer, OAuth, and email/password multi-session flows.

### Changed
- Toolset expanded from 47 to 61 canonical tools.
- CLI usability and setup guidance improved with richer diagnostics and ready-to-paste config snippets.
- `test:e2e` now validates HTTP email/password multi-session auth alongside bearer and OAuth HTTP coverage.

### Fixed
- `list_docs` titles are restored from workspace metadata snapshots.
- HTTP transport now preserves email/password credentials across fresh sessions so repeated Streamable HTTP connections can re-authenticate successfully.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `read_database_columns` to expose database schema metadata for empty or sparsely populated AFFiNE databases.
- Preset-backed `data_view` creation for kanban-oriented AFFiNE database views.
- Focused supporting-tools regression coverage via `npm run test:supporting-tools`.
- Markdown callout round-trips for admonition-style import/export flows.

### Changed
- `test:comprehensive` now self-bootstraps a local Docker AFFiNE stack and provides a raw mode for pre-provisioned environments.
- `test:e2e` now isolates Docker stacks per run and seeds data-view state before Playwright verification.
- README release history was trimmed in favor of dedicated changelog and release-note sources.

### Fixed
- Empty database workflows no longer depend on existing rows to discover column names, IDs, types, and view mappings.
- Reduced Docker bootstrap flakiness in the E2E pipeline by isolating Compose projects and staging startup checks.
- Prevented the E2E Playwright suite from failing on missing `test-data-view-state.json` by adding the data-view setup phase.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 43 to 46 canonical tools.
- Database workflows now support row title persistence and cell-level sync for Kanban-oriented databases.
- README and release documentation now describe the new database cell workflows and CLI version support.

### Fixed
- `add_database_row` now persists `title` / `Title` into the built-in row paragraph used by AFFiNE Kanban card headers.
- CLI version handling now exits early without starting the server, including forwarded wrapper args such as `affine-mcp -- --version`.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Tag visibility regression coverage in Docker E2E:
  - MCP setup scenario: `tests/test-tag-visibility.mjs`
  - Playwright UI verification: `tests/playwright/verify-tag-visibility.pw.ts`
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap retry controls:
  - `AFFINE_HEALTH_MAX_RETRIES`
  - `AFFINE_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS`
  - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_ACQUIRE_RETRIES`
  - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`

### Changed
- Tag persistence now aligns with AFFiNE tag option schema by storing canonical tag option IDs and normalizing legacy tag entries.
- Tag-facing tool outputs now resolve option IDs back to labels for stable UX parity (`read_doc`, `list_docs`, `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, markdown export).
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap now emits health-check configuration and retries credential acquisition before failing.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where tags persisted via MCP were not visible in the AFFiNE UI.
- Reduced CI flakiness from transient AFFiNE container startup timing by adding retry and on-failure Docker diagnostics.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- MCP-created document block hierarchy now follows AFFiNE UI parity by writing `sys:parent` as `null` and relying on `sys:children` relationships.
- Placement resolution for `append_block` (`beforeBlockId` / `afterBlockId`) now resolves parent context from child links when `sys:parent` is null.
- Workspace bootstrap document blocks were aligned to the same null-parent shape for consistency.

### Fixed
- Resolved UI invisibility/inconsistency risk for MCP-created docs caused by parent linkage mismatch versus UI-created docs.
- Fixed callout rendering parity by creating/storing callout text in a child paragraph block so text is visible in AFFiNE UI.
- Added regression assertions in Docker E2E scripts to verify null-parent structure after `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, and `create_doc_from_markdown`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Optional HTTP deployment mode with Streamable HTTP endpoint `/mcp` and backward-compatible legacy endpoints (`/sse`, `/messages`) for remote MCP clients.
- New `start:http` npm script (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http node dist/index.js`) for one-command HTTP mode startup.
- HTTP runtime dependencies and typings for remote hosting (`express`, `cors`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`).

### Changed
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` now supports `stdio` (default), `http`/`streamable`, and legacy alias `sse`.
- Added HTTP deployment environment controls: `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_HOST`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`.
- WebSocket ack flow was simplified with shared timeout/error handling utilities.
- Workspace bootstrap now propagates the optional `avatar` argument into initial workspace metadata.
- README and remote deployment guidance expanded with security defaults and hosting presets.

### Fixed

- Removed dead config/type scaffolding and tightened internal config parsing for header JSON.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- 11 new document workflow tools: `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, `create_tag`, `add_tag_to_doc`, `remove_tag_from_doc`, `export_doc_markdown`, `create_doc_from_markdown`, `append_markdown`, `replace_doc_with_markdown`, `add_database_column`, `add_database_row`.
- Interactive CLI subcommands: `affine-mcp login`, `affine-mcp status`, `affine-mcp logout`.
- End-to-end verification pipeline with Docker and Playwright (`tests/run-e2e.sh`, `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).
- New npm test commands: `test:e2e`, `test:db-create`, `test:bearer`, `test:playwright`.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 32 to 43 canonical tools.
- Runtime server version now resolves from `package.json` through `src/config.ts` (`VERSION`) and is reused by runtime/CLI user-agent headers.
- Authentication/bootstrap flow supports config-file fallback (`~/.config/affine-mcp/config`) and Bearer headers across GraphQL/WebSocket paths.
- `list_docs` now enriches each document node with tags from workspace metadata snapshots.
- Added markdown and E2E test dependencies in package metadata (`markdown-it`, `@types/markdown-it`, `@playwright/test`).
- `workspaces` and `blobStorage` tools now use typed `GraphQLClient` accessors and shared bearer/cookie propagation.
- `test-comprehensive.mjs` now asserts tag workflows and markdown roundtrip workflows.

### Fixed
- Hardened GraphQL/auth error handling for redirects, non-JSON responses, and timeout boundaries.
- Added CR/LF guardrails for cookie/header handling to prevent header-injection edge cases.
- Added `.gitignore` rules for generated E2E and Playwright artifacts.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `append_block` Step4 types: `database`, `data_view`, `surface_ref`, `frame`, `edgeless_text`, `note`.
- Local integration coverage for all append profiles (`step1`..`step4`) in `scripts/test-append-block-expansion.mjs`.

### Changed
- `append_block` canonical type set expanded to 30 verified cases with stricter field validation and parent-container checks.
- Step4 creation payloads now use Yjs-native value types (`Y.Map`/`Y.Array`) to avoid runtime serialization failures.

### Fixed
- Resolved `Unexpected content type` failures while appending database/edgeless blocks.
- Aligned `surface_ref` caption validation with block creation behavior.
- Prevented AFFiNE UI runtime crashes from `type=data_view` by mapping it to stable `affine:database` output.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-13

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Open-source community health files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- GitHub community templates: bug/feature issue templates and PR template.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and Dependabot config.
- Tool manifest (`tool-manifest.json`) and static verification script (`npm run test:tool-manifest`).

### Changed
- Tool surface simplified to 31 canonical tools with no duplicated alias names.
- Comprehensive integration test script now validates runtime tool list against `tool-manifest.json`.
- Package metadata improved (`bugs`, `homepage`) and new quality scripts (`npm run ci`, `npm run pack:check`).

### Removed
- Duplicated alias tools (`affine_*`) and low-value/unstable tools from default surface.
- Deprecated `src/tools/updates.ts` and legacy workspace fixed alias tooling.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed
- CLI binary now runs through Node via `bin/affine-mcp`, preventing shells from misinterpreting ESM JS files and avoiding false startup timeouts.

### Changed
- Documentation: removed `.env`-based configuration guidance; recommend environment variables via shell or app configuration.
- Version badges and examples refreshed; clarified non-blocking login default.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-17

### Changed
- Default startup authentication is now asynchronous when using email/password to avoid MCP stdio handshake timeouts. Use `AFFINE_LOGIN_AT_START=sync` only when blocking startup is required.
- Docs fully refreshed: clear instructions for Codex CLI and Claude Desktop using npm, npx, and local clone workflows.

### Added
- README examples for `codex mcp add` with `affine-mcp` and with `npx -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp`.
- Local clone usage guide and `npm link` workflow.

### Removed
- Unnecessary repo artifacts (e.g., `.env.example`, `.dockerignore`).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-16
